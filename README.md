# Chore Board
Chore board to keep track of who has done which chore <br>
Mainly just to learn to use flask

* Install requirements
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

* Set this environment variable
```
export FLASK_APP="main.py"
```

* Kick it off
```
python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0
```

Once the above is run, it will log the address the app is being ported to
This is set via the --host =0.0.0.0 so it should always be 
```
http://0.0.0.0:5000/
```
